Step 1: Identify the Given Information
- Mass of block (m) = 10 kg
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s²
- Coefficient of static friction (μₛ) = 0.2
- Applied horizontal force (F) = 10 N
```

```
Step 2: Calculate the Normal Force (N)
Since the block is on a horizontal surface with no vertical acceleration:
N = mg
N = 10 kg × 9.81 m/s²
N = 98.1 N
```

```
Step 3: Calculate the Maximum Static Friction Force
The maximum static friction force is:
f_max = μₛ × N
f_max = 0.2 × 98.1
f_max = 19.62 N
```

```
Step 4: Compare Applied Force with Maximum Static Friction
Applied force (F) = 10 N
Maximum static friction (f_max) = 19.62 N

Since F < f_max:
10 N < 19.62 N

The block will NOT move (remains stationary)
```

```
Step 5: Determine the Actual Friction Force
Since the block is stationary, it's in equilibrium.
The friction force must balance the applied force:

f_friction = F_applied
f_friction = 10 N
```

```
Final Answer:
The magnitude of the force of friction on the block is 10 N

This is static friction that prevents the block from moving.
