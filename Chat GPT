Step 1: Write the given data
Mass of block (m) = 10 kg
Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s²
Coefficient of static friction (μₛ) = 0.2
Applied horizontal force = 10 N

Step 2: Find the normal reaction force

(The block is on a horizontal floor, so normal = weight)

Normal force (N) = m × g
                 = 10 × 9.81
                 = 98.1 N

Step 3: Find the maximum static friction possible
Maximum static friction (fₘₐₓ) = μₛ × N
                               = 0.2 × 98.1
                               = 19.62 N

Step 4: Compare applied force with maximum static friction
Applied force = 10 N
Maximum static friction = 19.62 N


Since:

10 N < 19.62 N


➡️ The block will not move
➡️ Static friction adjusts itself to balance the applied force

Step 5: Find the actual friction force
Friction force = Applied force
                = 10 N

✅ Final Answer
Magnitude of friction force on the block = 10 N
