Based on the problem provided in the image, here is the step-by-step solution to find the magnitude of the force of friction.

### **Problem Analysis**

* **Mass ():** 
* **Acceleration due to gravity ():** 
* **Coefficient of static friction ():** 
* **Applied horizontal force ():** 

### **Step-by-Step Calculation**

```text
Step 1: Calculate the Normal Force (N)
The normal force for a block on a horizontal surface is equal to its weight.
N = m * g
N = 10 kg * 9.81 m/s^2
N = 98.1 N

Step 2: Calculate the Maximum Static Friction (f_limit)
This is the "limiting friction," which is the maximum force the 
surface can exert to prevent motion.
f_limit = μs * N
f_limit = 0.2 * 98.1 N
f_limit = 19.62 N

Step 3: Compare Applied Force with Limiting Friction
- If Applied Force > Limiting Friction: The block moves (kinetic friction applies).
- If Applied Force <= Limiting Friction: The block remains at rest.

In this case:
Applied Force (10 N) < Limiting Friction (19.62 N)

Step 4: Determine the Actual Friction Force
Since the applied force is less than the maximum possible static friction, 
the block does not move. In a state of static equilibrium, the 
friction force must exactly equal the applied force to keep the 
net force zero.

Friction Force = Applied Force
Friction Force = 10 N

```

**Final Answer:**
The magnitude of the force of friction on the block is ****.
